# MyMath - TDD Practice

A C# library project focused on practicing **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and algorithm optimization.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** C# (.NET Core)
- **Testing Framework:** NUnit / MSTest
- **Tool:** Visual Studio Test Explorer

## Development Workflow (TDD)

I followed the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle to develop the `SquareRoot` method:

1. **Red:** Wrote unit tests before implementing any logic.
2. **Green:** Implemented the minimum code necessary to pass the tests.
3. **Refactor:** Optimized the algorithm using the **Newton-Raphson** method while ensuring all tests remained passing.

## Testing Scenarios

- **Value Range:** Verified the algorithm across a broad range of inputs from $1e^{-8}$ to $1e^{+8}$.
- **Error Handling:** Handled negative inputs by throwing an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`.
- **Code Coverage:** Ensured all logic paths and decision points were exercised by unit tests.

## How to Run

1. Open the `.sln` file in **Visual Studio**.
2. Open **Test Explorer** (`Ctrl + E, T`).
3. Click **Run All** (`Ctrl + R, A`) to execute the test suite.

*This project was developed as a hands-on exercise in Software Quality Assurance and TDD principles.*
